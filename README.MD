This is a prototype that demonstrates the SweepAI workflow in EvaDB.

This app uses gpt and embedding models that are provided by OpenAI. The gpt is integrated into EvaDBs support for ChatGPT in queries. It has tables that are used to store both code snippets/embeddings and the responses generated by the similarity search provided by EvaDB.
The FAISS index is used due to faster performance over other vector indices. This FAISS integration and index creating is supported by EvaDB

Finally, there is also a STR2ARRAY function that converts inputted string dataframes into floats that can be read by the similarity function in EvaDB. When adding an array to the SQLITE column provided by EvaDB,the entries were converted to strings. This function ensured that floats could be passed into the similarity function to enable it to work.
